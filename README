Friendheat is a little application that shows a heatmap of your Facebook
friends' locations.

It uses the Google Geocode API to find coordinates for cities, taking
the first match. Because this API is limited, a thin proxy wrapper
(application.py) is used to cache responses to limit total number
of requests and number of requests per second.

The "API" takes a location name and returns a {'lat', 'long'} object.

All Facebook authorisation is done client-side via javascript, and the
only data sent to the server are location names (which aren't associated with
Facebook IDs).
